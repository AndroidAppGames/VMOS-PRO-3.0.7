VMOS Pro is the Pro version of VMOS, one of the best applications for virtualizing an Android operating system from your own smartphone or tablet. With this advanced version, you can customize the ROM to be emulated.
-----------------------------------------
Among the tools included in the app, you'll find the option to install Xposed modules, enjoy preinstalled Google services, superimpose any app over another, or change the resolution of the device to the one you want. The app gives you a choice of Android versions so you can make modifications depending on what you want to do.
